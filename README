Scraper is an application that demonstrates saving Craigslist search terms. Then, in the background a Node.js process reads those saved search terms, queries Craigslist and stores the results in the database.

The system was initially implemented to run on AWS but could also be ported to run on Azure w/ the DynamoDb connection back to AWS.

An architecture diagram is available in the ScraperDesing.png file.
